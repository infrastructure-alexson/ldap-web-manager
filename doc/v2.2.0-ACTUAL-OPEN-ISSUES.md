## 🎯 Key Differences from Initial "Container & Monitoring" Roadmap

### What We Initially Planned vs. What's Actually Open

**Initially Planned**:
- Kubernetes Manifests
- Kubernetes Ingress & Networking
- StatefulSet for Persistence
- OpenShift Templates
- OpenShift Security & Permissions
- Prometheus Metrics
- Health Checks & Observability
- Logging & Tracing
- GitHub Actions Workflows
- Automated Testing & Quality

**Actually Open**:
- Podman Support ✓
- Container Registry Integration ✓
- IPv6 Support (IPAM, DNS, DHCP) ✓
- DHCP Lease Monitoring ✓
- LDAP Health Monitoring ✓
- Service Status Dashboard ✓
- Alerts & Notifications ✓
- Performance: Caching ✓
- Performance: Database Optimization ✓
- Performance: Frontend ✓

**Key Findings**:
1. **Kubernetes/OpenShift** are mentioned in Issue #45 but split into v3.0.0 phase
2. **Prometheus/Logging** are NOT currently issues for v2.2.0
3. **CI/CD & Testing** are NOT currently issues for v2.2.0
4. **Focus is on**: Docker maturity, IPv6, operational monitoring, performance

## ✅ What Needs Clarification

1. **Issue #45 Scope**: It mentions v3.0.0 Kubernetes/OpenShift as Phase 2
   - Should we focus only on v2.2.0 Docker/Podman for now?
   - Or implement Kubernetes/OpenShift Phase 2 requirements?

2. **Issue Dependencies**: Some issues may have dependencies
   - #18, #19, #20 all contribute to monitoring ecosystem
   - #22, #23, #24 all contribute to performance

3. **Kubernetes Decision**: 
   - The initial roadmap had K8s/OpenShift for v2.2.0
   - Issue #45 shows them as v3.0.0
   - Need to clarify release versioning

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Confirm Implementation Order**: Which priority sequence?
2. **Clarify v3.0.0 Scope**: Should Kubernetes/OpenShift be in v2.2.0 or v3.0.0?
3. **Start Issue #16**: Podman Support (ready to begin immediately)
4. **Update Project Board**: Reorder based on priorities

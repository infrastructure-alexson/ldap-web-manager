## 🎯 Recommended Next: Issue #19 - LDAP Server Health Monitoring

### Why This Issue?
1. **Logical Sequence**: Monitoring Phase continuation
2. **Dependencies**: Independent, can start immediately
3. **Effort**: 3-4 days (manageable)
4. **Value**: Critical operational visibility
5. **Completes Monitoring Triad**: With #18, leads to #20

### Scope: LDAP Server Health Monitoring

**Backend Requirements**:
- Connection status to primary/secondary LDAP servers
- Replication lag monitoring
- Query performance metrics
- Connection pool statistics
- Replication status queries
- Real-time health indicators

**Frontend Requirements**:
- LDAP server status display
- Replication lag metrics
- Query performance statistics
- Connection pool health
- Alert integration
- Historical health data

**Deliverables**:
- Backend API endpoints for LDAP monitoring
- Pydantic data models
- Frontend React components
- Real-time health dashboard
- Alert system integration
- Sign-off documentation

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Complexity**: Medium (similar to DHCP monitoring)

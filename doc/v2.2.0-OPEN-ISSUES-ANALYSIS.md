## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

### Priority 1: Container Support (Foundation)
These should be done first as other phases may depend on container deployment

1. **Issue #16**: Podman Support & Compatibility (2-3 days)
2. **Issue #17**: Container Registry Integration (2-3 days)
3. **Issue #45**: Container Deployment - Orchestration (3-5 days)

**Rationale**: Once containers are fully supported and published, foundation is complete

### Priority 2: Monitoring & Health (Production Ready)
These are critical for production deployments

4. **Issue #18**: DHCP Lease Monitoring (3-4 days)
5. **Issue #19**: LDAP Server Health Monitoring (3-4 days)
6. **Issue #20**: Service Status Dashboard (3-4 days)

**Rationale**: Visibility into system health is essential for operations

### Priority 3: IPv6 Support (Network Ready)
These enable modern network configurations

7. **Issue #15**: IPv6 Support - IPAM (2-3 days)
8. **Issue #16**: IPv6 Support - DNS (2-3 days)
9. **Issue #17**: IPv6 Support - DHCP (2-3 days)

**Rationale**: IPv6 is becoming mainstream; this enables future-proofing

### Priority 4: Performance & Alerts (Optimization)
These improve performance and operational capabilities

10. **Issue #21**: Alerts & Notifications (2-3 days)
11. **Issue #22**: Performance - Caching (2-3 days)
12. **Issue #23**: Performance - Database Optimization (2-3 days)

## 💡 Key Observations

### Differences from Initial Roadmap

The actual open v2.2.0 issues differ from the initially created roadmap:

**Initially Planned**:
- Docker Image & Configuration ✅
- Kubernetes Manifests
- Kubernetes Ingress & Networking
- StatefulSet for Persistence
- OpenShift Templates
- OpenShift Security & Permissions
- Prometheus Metrics
- Health Checks & Observability
- Logging & Tracing
- GitHub Actions Workflows
- Automated Testing & Quality

**Actually Open**:
- Podman Support & Compatibility
- Container Registry Integration
- Container Deployment (Docker/Podman/K8s/OpenShift) - Meta issue
- IPv6 Support (IPAM, DNS, DHCP)
- DHCP Lease Monitoring
- LDAP Server Health Monitoring
- Service Status Dashboard
- Alerts & Notifications
- Performance Enhancements (Caching, DB, Frontend)

### Strategic Shift

The actual v2.2.0 focuses on:
1. **Production Operations** (monitoring, health checks, alerts)
2. **Network Features** (IPv6 support)
3. **Performance** (caching, optimization)
4. **Container Support** (Podman, registry integration)

Rather than the initially planned infrastructure focus (K8s, OpenShift, CI/CD).

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Clarify which issues take priority
2. Decide if the initial "Container & Monitoring" roadmap should be updated
3. Determine if "Kubernetes/OpenShift" features should be created as separate issues or included in #45

### Questions to Resolve
1. Should we implement Kubernetes/OpenShift now or defer to v2.3.0?
2. Should we prioritize IPv6 support or container features?
3. Are the performance enhancements critical for this release?

## ✅ Action Items

- [ ] Review the actual v2.2.0 issues and prioritization
- [ ] Decide on Kubernetes/OpenShift scope for v2.2.0
- [ ] Create implementation plan based on priority
- [ ] Update project board with new priorities
- [ ] Begin implementation of priority-1 issues

---

**Status**: Ready for Review & Planning  
**Next Step**: Determine implementation priorities and start Phase 1 of revised v2.2.0
